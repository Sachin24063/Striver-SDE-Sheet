# **Striver’s SDE Sheet With It’s Short Algo and Complexities**

In this valuable contribution, we present a meticulously curated PDF file designed to assist college students aspiring to excel as software developers. My comprehensive guide includes a compilation of questions, problem-solving approaches, concise algorithms, and the associated time and space complexities, all based on Striver's SDE sheet. By following this guide, students can efficiently prepare for interviews within a short time frame of 3 to 4 hours. The questions presented have been handpicked by Striver bhaiya, making them particularly significant and beneficial for interview preparation.

## Structure of the Study Guide:

1. **Question Name:** Each question is clearly labeled, along with its corresponding platform name.
2. **Approach to Solve:** Step-by-step guidance is provided, offering a systematic and structured methodology to tackle each problem.
3. **Small Algorithm:** Succinct algorithms are included to present a concise yet comprehensive solution to each question.
4. **Time & Space Complexities:** The complexities associated with each solution are outlined, giving students a holistic understanding of performance considerations.
